# Details

Api used : EasyExploits

I also have my own api


EasyExploits never worked for me so idk why so i used wearedevs (even though their executor downloads and api are sketchy as hell)
Also you can decompile it and find no malware other then 
the api and the fast colored text box because i wouldn't be an idiot and put malware on github like who does that?



# Download & Compiled

Releases tab
↑ DOWNLOAD AT ↑



You can download it there on the releases.
And make sure to close out any ads or anything popup's as they are just part of the download operator to make money so don't install anything other then the Zip file which the only thing you should get if not just run a virus scan whatever shit

I also put the DLLs of the api and fast colored text box if u want to create your own or whatever
in the files above me
